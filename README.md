# Spotify-Tracks-Insights

## Topic
- What are the most popular genres of music?
- How wildly do pieces/songs vary among different attributes?
- Can we presume a correlation between the major mode and emotional positiveness?
- What characteristics bode **popularity** for a song?

## Methodology
All these questions are examined within [this notebook](./src/SpotifyTracksInsights.ipynb) using `Python`:
- Data acquisition, cleaning, and wrangling using `NumPy` & `Pandas`
- Data visualization using `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn`
- Regularized regression modeling using `Scikit-learn`
  - Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)
  - Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)
